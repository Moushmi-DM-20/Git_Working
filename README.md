# Git Working Test

This repository was created as a test to check if Git is properly configured and working. It includes a simple file (like index.html or README.md) and was used to practice basic Git commands:

- `git init` – initialize local repository
- `git add` – stage changes
- `git commit` – save changes locally
- `git remote add origin` – connect to GitHub
- `git push` – upload changes to GitHub

This helps ensure Git is ready for real project development.# Git_Working
This project was created to test and verify that Git and GitHub are working correctly. It includes basic commands such as git init, git add, git commit, and git push. The purpose was to practice version control and ensure proper connection between the local repository and GitHub.
